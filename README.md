        I'm Divyansh Rai, an enthusiastic and dedicated software engineer with a passion for building innovative solutions. I specialize in full-stack development and have a strong foundation in a range of programming languages including C/C++, Python, and JavaScript. My expertise extends to web technologies such as HTML5, CSS, and React.js, and I have hands-on experience with databases like MongoDB and SQL/MySQL.
        Throughout my academic journey at Gyan Ganga Institute of Technology & Sciences, I've maintained an impressive CGPA of 8.72/10, reflecting my commitment to excellence. I've been recognized as a Microsoft Engage '22 Finalist and achieved a 5-star rating in C++ and Data Structures and Algorithms on HackerRank. I've also been acknowledged as a Codechef 3-star coder with a rating of 1600+ and have successfully solved over 500 DSA problems on platforms like LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks.
        What truly sets me apart is my versatility in both front-end and back-end development and my proficiency in cloud platforms such as AWS and Oracle Cloud. My problem-solving skills, coupled with a deep understanding of Test-Driven Development and Object-Oriented Programming, allow me to excel in complex software projects.
        In addition to my academic achievements, I've gained valuable industry exposure through internships with Microsoft and Oasis Infobyte, where I worked on core Java development and data analysis projects. I've recently secured an offer as an Associated Solution Leader Trainee for a US-based startup, with a focus on Platform as a Service (PaaS) development in Hyderabad.
        I am passionate about continual learning and believe in the power of personal growth. I'm excited to explore opportunities that allow me to further develop my skills and make a meaningful impact in the world of technology.
